"""Guard: every tool ships a title, and every tool that can change
something declares whether the change may be destructive.

The Anthropic Connectors Directory requires `title` and the applicable
hints on every tool, and a client shows the title to a human instead of
the raw tool name, so a missing or wrong one is a product defect rather
than a documentation nit. Three things are checked here.

FIRST, coverage and shape on the wire: every registered tool carries a
non-empty title, titles are unique within this server, none exceeds 40
characters, and none carries product or marketing language.

SECOND, the classification itself. The non-destructive allowlist below is
hand-audited and lives in the TEST on purpose. `core/tool_annotations.py`
is where the server reads its classification from; if both sides shared
one list the test would only prove the file equals itself. A new tool
consequently fails twice until somebody classifies it deliberately, once
at registration, where `annotations()` raises on an unclassified mutating
name, and once here.

THIRD, the published tables. `docs/TOOL_TITLES.md` and
`docs/TOOL_ANNOTATIONS.md` are what a reviewer reads and what a maintainer
disputes a row in. They are generated from the module, so they are checked
against it here; a table that drifts from the wire is worse than no table.
