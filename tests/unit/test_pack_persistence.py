"""A pack switched on or off stays that way until a person or the AI
changes it again (owner ruling, 2026-09-26: "If someone switches it on,
they don't expect it to revert. I know I wouldn't.").

Before this, the choice lasted only as long as the MCP session that made
it: the next session (a restart of the app, a new conversation) started
again from the launch settings, and until punch-list #933 fastmcp also
dropped it a day into the same session. Now every enable_tools and
disable_tools call is saved (packstore.py) and every later session starts
from the launch settings plus the saved choices, while a launch-time lock
still wins over anything saved.

"A day later" is simulated the way the #933 gates do it: fastmcp's
one-day session-state lifetime is cut to 2 s and the test waits past it.
"A restart" is the real main() run again in the same process with every
pack record reset (in-process), or a second child process (stdio).

Fail-first: every test here fails on the #933 head, where nothing is
saved. This file is the same in the Word, PowerPoint and Excel repos apart
from the product block below.
