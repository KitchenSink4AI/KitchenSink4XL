"""Punch-list #933: a session's packs are its own, and they do not expire.

fastmcp kept the per-session visibility rules the pre-#933 pack toggles
relied on in its session state store, with a one-day time-to-live. When a
rule expired, an enabled pack's tools dropped out of tools/list, calls
answered "Unknown tool", and enable_tools answered "already enabled"
without bringing them back (shipped in Word 2.2.0, PowerPoint 1.3.1 and
Excel 1.2.4). The fix keeps one pack record per MCP session in this
server's own middleware (packstate, packgate) and uses no fastmcp
visibility state at all.

The seven gates Codex set for the fix (X-20260924-005): two-session
isolation; survival of a shortened TTL; re-enable behaviour; a
session-local list_changed; refusal of stale calls; garbage-collection
cleanup; default and locked single-session surfaces unchanged.

Fail-first: every test here except the two gate-7 regression guards fails
on the pre-#933 code. The gate-7 tests pin the default and locked surfaces
as they were, so they pass on both, which is what "unchanged" means.

This file is the same in the Word, PowerPoint and Excel repos apart from
the product block below.
